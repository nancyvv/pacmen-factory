# PacMen Factory Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to create a pacman on demand by clicling the 'Add PacMan' button. Once the pac man has been created, the animation would start by clicking 'Start Game.'

How to run:
Load the index.html file into any browser. Once loaded, click on the 'Add PacMan' button, followed by the 'Start Game' button. 

Future Improvements:
- Graphic Optimization
- Update orientation of the pacman once it goes from right to left of the screen.
